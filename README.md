# Mips-Assembly-Calculator
This project is a menu-driven calculator written in MIPS Assembly language that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It makes use of MIPS syscalls for input/output, stores values in registers, and demonstrates the use of branching and jumps for decision-making. The program runs in a loop, letting users perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit, making it feel like a simple interactive console application. This project is especially useful for students learning Computer Organization and Assembly Language, as it provides a practical example of how low-level instructions can be used to build functional programs while reinforcing key concepts such as arithmetic operations, branching, and program control flow.
